# Adding a Splash Screen

Actually, you know enough to complete this by yourself.  Using similar logic to the screen that is shown when pressing reset, you can make a splash screen that displays the name of the program '8Bit-Etch' for three seconds when the game first starts.

> Your Turn: <br/>
> 1) Create a new function, called `splashScreen()` that sets the cursor to location (10, 27) and the font size to 2.  <br/>
> 2) Print the word '8Bit-Etch' and wait 3 full seconds before completing the function.<br/>
> 3) Add a call to `splashScren()` at the end of `setup()` to show the splash screen once when the program starts.
